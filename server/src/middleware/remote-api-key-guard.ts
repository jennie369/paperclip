/**
 * Remote API-key guard.
 *
 * Paperclip runs in `local_trusted` mode: every local request is treated as a
 * trusted board actor with no auth. That is fine for `localhost:3100` (the owner's
 * machine), but the server is ALSO exposed publicly through a Cloudflare tunnel
 * (gemops.gemcapitalholding.com → localhost:3100). Without this guard, anyone who
 * knows the URL can hit the control plane unauthenticated (run agents, read configs,
 * CRM, chat history). See HARD RULE #0 ("Paperclip access ONLY via localhost").
 *
 * This guard requires a shared `PAPERCLIP_API_KEY` for REMOTE requests only:
 *   - Local (loopback) requests        → pass (the UI + local tooling, trusted).
 *   - Remote, self-authenticating paths → pass (webhooks verify their own signatures,
 *     health is harmless): see EXEMPT_PREFIXES.
 *   - Remote, everything else          → require a valid PAPERCLIP_API_KEY, else 401.
 *
 * "Remote" is detected via `cf-connecting-ip` / `cf-ray`, which Cloudflare ALWAYS
 * adds on the tunnel and a client cannot strip, so it cannot be spoofed by sending a
 * fake `Host: localhost` header. A non-loopback Host is also treated as remote.
 *
 * Fail-closed: if PAPERCLIP_API_KEY is unset, ALL non-exempt remote requests are
 * rejected (the hole stays closed even when misconfigured).
